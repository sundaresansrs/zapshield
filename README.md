## 1. The Problem We Are Solving

India's Q-commerce sector — Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart — runs on a **10-minute delivery SLA**. This is the most operationally demanding constraint in last-mile logistics.

Riders in this segment earn ₹18,000–₹25,000/month completing high-frequency short-distance deliveries, paid per run with no base salary and no buffer.

**The insight every other team misses:**

> For a 10-minute SLA worker, a 15-minute rain burst is not a slowdown.
> It is a complete, unrecoverable income-loss event.

A Swiggy rider can resume after rain stops. A Zepto rider who misses the SLA window **loses the delivery fee, receives an SLA breach penalty, and risks algorithmic downgrading** — three cascading income hits from one short disruption.

When a zone-level curfew is imposed, when their dark store shuts unexpectedly, when AQI crosses 300 or temperature hits 42°C — they earn zero. And right now, **zero insurance protection exists for these workers anywhere in India.**

ZapShield fixes this. When a disruption hits, ZapShield detects it, validates it, checks for fraud, and pays the rider automatically — **in under 3 minutes. No claim filing. No paperwork. No waiting.**

---

## 2. Why Q-Commerce, Not Food Delivery

Almost every competing team will build for Zomato or Swiggy riders. We deliberately chose Zepto and Blinkit for four actuarial reasons:

| Dimension | Food Delivery (Zomato/Swiggy) | ZapShield — Q-Commerce (Zepto/Blinkit) |
|---|---|---|
| SLA window | 30–45 minutes | **10 minutes** |
| Disruption impact | Partial slowdown | **Full income-loss event** |
| Risk scope | City-level | **500m dark store radius** |
| Order frequency | 3–5/hour | **6–10/hour** |
| Income model | Per delivery + tips | **Per delivery, tip-free, SLA-penalised** |
| Fraud detection signal | Generic GPS | **Dark store dispatch log correlation** |
| Risk pricing granularity | Neighbourhood | **Hyper-local zone (500m)** |

This choice gives ZapShield a unique anti-fraud signal unavailable to food delivery platforms: **dark store order dispatch logs.** If the store is still dispatching 80% of normal orders during a rain event, the disruption wasn't severe — payout denied. No other insurance model in this hackathon can do this.

---

## 3. Our Persona — Meet Ravi

**Ravi, 26 — Zepto delivery partner, Koramangala, Bengaluru**

- Works 8 AM–8 PM, 6 days/week from 2 dark stores within 500m
- Completes 8–10 deliveries/hour, earns ₹700–₹800/day
- Has no savings buffer — one income disruption means skipped meals
- Owns a smartphone, uses UPI daily, has no time to file claims
- Has never heard of parametric insurance, but immediately understands "paid automatically when it rains"
- Migrant worker from rural Tamil Nadu — no credit history, no formal financial safety net

**What Ravi is NOT:**

He is not a Swiggy rider doing 30-minute deliveries who can wait out a storm. He is not a salaried worker with an HR department. He is not a customer of any existing insurance product. He has no union, no platform guarantee, and no margin for error.

**Ravi is the gap in the entire Indian insurance market. ZapShield was built specifically for him.**

---

## 4. A Day in Ravi's Life: What Insurance Means to Him

> *7:58 AM — Ravi checks in on the Zepto app. The zone indicator on ZapShield is amber. He opens it: "Rain risk elevated today. You're covered."*

> *10:41 AM — It starts raining. Hard. In 60 seconds, Ravi would normally just wait — losing ₹80–₹100 for every 15 minutes of downtime.*

> *10:44 AM — His phone buzzes. "₹120 credited. Rain protection activated." He didn't file anything. He didn't call anyone. He just received money.*

> *11:02 AM — Rain eases. Ravi is back on the road. He didn't skip lunch. He didn't borrow from his roommate.*

This is what ZapShield means to Ravi — not a financial product, not an insurance policy. **A guarantee that the platform he works for finally has his back.**

Every design decision — 10-minute SLA awareness, weekly premiums, zero-touch claims, UPI payout in 60 seconds — is built for this moment.

## 5. Persona-Based Scenarios & Application Workflow

### Scenario 1 — Rain Burst (Environmental Trigger)

```
10:42 AM  Open-Meteo API: 7.5mm precipitation at Koramangala grid point
10:43 AM  ZapShield trigger engine: threshold breached (>=4mm/15min)
10:43 AM  Dispatch log cross-check: Zepto store dispatching 15% of baseline
          -> Disruption confirmed real, not a dry-run abuse attempt
10:43 AM  Fraud engine: GPS in zone, policy >24hrs old, claim freq ok
          -> fraud_score: 0.12 -> AUTO APPROVED
10:44 AM  Payout calculated: ₹80/hr x 1.0 x 1.5hrs = ₹120
10:44 AM  Razorpay mock payout: pout_mock_1773559569682 -> PAID
10:44 AM  Push notification: "₹120 credited. Rain protection activated."
```

**Total elapsed time: under 3 minutes. Zero rider action required.**

### Scenario 2 — Extreme Heat (Environmental Trigger)

```
2:15 PM   Open-Meteo: temperature 42°C at Indiranagar (threshold: >=40°C)
          Active window: 12PM–4PM only (peak heat hours, income-loss window)
2:15 PM   Dispatch volume check: store at 40% baseline -> confirmed disruption
2:16 PM   Payout: ₹80/hr x 0.75 x 2hrs = ₹120 (heat multiplier applied)
```

### Scenario 3 — Dark Store Closure (Social Trigger)

```
6:30 PM   Zepto ops feed: Store #KR-04 status = CLOSED (unexpected)
6:30 PM   All riders with active policies in this zone auto-identified
6:31 PM   Batch payouts: ₹80/hr x 1.25 x 2hrs = ₹200 each
          (peak-hour complete-loss rate — store closed = zero earnings possible)
```

### Scenario 4 — Curfew / Zone Lockdown (Social Trigger)

```
[Mocked]  Government alert feed: Section 144 imposed in HSR Layout
          All active ZapShield policies in affected zone auto-triggered
          Payout per rider: remaining shift hours x ₹100/hr (capped at 8hrs)
```

---

### Application Workflow

**Platform choice: React PWA (Progressive Web App)**

We chose PWA over native mobile for reasons that matter to Ravi specifically:
- No app store — works the moment he opens a link from WhatsApp
- Installs to home screen with a single tap — same as UPI apps he uses daily
- Works on 2-year-old budget Android devices, not just flagship phones
- One codebase serves both rider-facing and insurer-facing dashboards

```
[ONBOARDING — 2 minutes to active coverage]
  Open ZapShield PWA on mobile browser (shared link from Zepto partner group)
  -> OTP login via mobile number (no email, no password, no friction)
  -> Select dark store zone on map (500m radius shown visually)
  -> Declare average daily earnings (₹100–₹5,000 range)
  -> KYC: Zepto/Blinkit Partner ID + Aadhaar last 4 digits
  -> AI engine scores zone risk -> generates weekly premium quote instantly
  -> Explainable AI Premium Card: plain-language breakdown of why this price
  -> Pay via Razorpay UPI — coverage active in the same second

[ACTIVE COVERAGE — zero effort from Ravi]
  -> Dashboard: active policy, coverage amount, zone risk level today
  -> Real-time zone indicator: green / amber / red (colour-coded, language-free)
  -> Trigger alerts: push notification the moment engine detects an event
  -> Nothing to do. All payouts happen automatically.

[AUTO-CLAIM AND PAYOUT — fully automated, no rider action]
  -> Trigger engine detects disruption every 15 minutes
  -> Fraud check runs in background (under 300ms)
  -> Payout hits UPI in under 60 seconds if approved
  -> Payout history downloadable as PDF for income tax records

[WEEKLY RENEWAL — Sunday, one tap]
  -> Notification: "Your coverage ends tonight. Renew for ₹X?"
  -> Updated premium reflects last week's actual zone weather data
  -> One-tap UPI renewal — same as recharging a mobile plan
```

## 6. Weekly Premium Model

### Why Weekly — and Why It Matters Actuarially

Gig workers have no monthly salary. They earn and spend week-to-week. A monthly premium creates a cash-flow barrier that kills adoption before it starts. Weekly pricing does three things simultaneously:

1. **Aligns with the earnings cycle** — Ravi earns ~₹700/day, pays ₹49–₹79/week. The premium is 1% of weekly income, not a month's savings.
2. **Reduces adverse selection** — Riders can't buy annual cover only during monsoon season. Weekly renewal means pricing adjusts every 7 days.
3. **Enables precise risk-period pricing** — Our ML model reprices every zone every Sunday. Week 1 of June monsoon costs more than week 1 of February winter. A monthly product cannot do this.

### Premium Tiers

| Tier | Weekly Premium | Max Weekly Payout | Hourly Rate | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic | ₹29 | ₹300 | ₹50/hr | Part-time (<4 hrs/day) |
| Standard | ₹49 | ₹600 | ₹80/hr | Full-time (6–8 hrs/day) |
| Premium | ₹79 | ₹1,200 | ₹120/hr | Peak specialists (8–12 hrs/day) |

### Dynamic Premium Formula (implemented and live)

```
Weekly Premium = Base × Zone Risk Multiplier × Season Factor × Tenure Discount

Zone Risk Multiplier:  0.80 (safe zone) to 1.40 (high-risk zone)
  Computed weekly by GBR ML model from:
    - Rain event frequency: last 30/90/180 days (Open-Meteo historical)
    - AQI exceedance days: last 30 days
    - Dark store closure frequency: last 90 days
    - Waterlogging risk score (static, from BBMP flood data)

Season Factor:
  Monsoon (Jun–Sep): 1.25  |  Summer (Mar–May): 1.10  |  Winter: 0.95

Tenure Discount: max(0.85, 1.0 - months_active × 0.01)
  Up to 15% loyalty discount after 15 months
  Actuarial rationale: long-tenure riders have proven legitimate claim
  behaviour — rewarding them improves retention of the cleanest risks.

Final premium always rounded to nearest ₹1 (integer INR)
```

**Live example — Ravi, Standard tier, Koramangala, March:**
```
₹49 × 1.35 (zone: high-risk) × 1.10 (summer) × 1.00 (new rider) = ₹73/week
```

### Explainable AI Premium Card

Every rider sees a plain-language breakdown before paying. This is not cosmetic — it is **actuarial transparency** that builds trust, satisfies IRDAI InsurTech requirements, and converts skeptical first-time buyers.

```
Your premium this week: ₹73

Why this price?
  Base rate (Standard tier)          ₹49  +
  Zone risk (Koramangala: high)      ₹17  +
  Season adjustment (Summer)          ₹7  +
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Total                              ₹73

  What drives your zone risk?
  → 11 rain events in last 30 days
  → Koramangala waterlogging risk: HIGH (BBMP data)
  → Dark store closure rate: 1.2× city average

  Your zone risk score will update every Sunday.
```

Ravi doesn't need to understand gradient boosting. He understands "my area floods a lot, so I pay a bit more." That is ZapShield's explainability goal.

## 7. Parametric Triggers

All 5 triggers are fully automatic. Riders never file claims. The engine polls every 15 minutes and fires payouts when thresholds breach.

**Core principle:** Every trigger threshold is calibrated to Q-commerce specifically. A 30-minute delivery worker can tolerate 15mm of rain. A 10-minute SLA worker cannot. Our thresholds are not borrowed from generic weather insurance — they are derived from the income-loss mechanics of the Zepto/Blinkit SLA model.

### Trigger 1 — Rain Burst (Environmental)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Data source | Open-Meteo Forecast API (free tier, no API key required) |
| Threshold | Precipitation ≥ 4.0mm in current 15-minute window |
| Active hours | All day |
| Payout rate | ₹80/hr × 1.0 multiplier (Standard tier) |
| Anti-fraud | Dark store dispatch volume must be < 40% of baseline |
| SLA rationale | 4mm/15min = road surface flooding in Bengaluru — impossible to maintain 10-min SLA |

### Trigger 2 — Extreme Heat (Environmental)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Data source | Open-Meteo Forecast API |
| Threshold | Temperature ≥ 40.0°C |
| Active hours | 12:00 PM – 4:00 PM IST only (peak heat window) |
| Payout rate | ₹80/hr × 0.75 multiplier |
| Rationale | Night heat does not cause income loss — time-window prevents gaming |

### Trigger 3 — Severe AQI (Environmental)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Data source | Open-Meteo Air Quality API (air-quality-api.open-meteo.com) |
| Threshold | US AQI ≥ 300 (Hazardous per CPCB classification) |
| Sustained | Minimum 2 hours before trigger fires |
| Payout rate | ₹80/hr × 0.625 multiplier |
| Rationale | 2-hour confirmation prevents false triggers from brief spikes |

### Trigger 4 — Dark Store Closure (Social)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Data source | Simulated Zepto/Blinkit operational API (mock) |
| Trigger | Store status = CLOSED during active shift hours |
| Payout rate | ₹80/hr × 1.25 multiplier (complete income loss) |
| Anti-fraud | Rider GPS must be within 500m of declared store zone |
| Anti-gaming | Rider must have ≥ 1 delivery recorded that day before trigger fires |

### Trigger 5 — Curfew / Zone Lockdown (Social)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Data source | Simulated government alert feed (mock JSON API) |
| Trigger | Section 144 or equivalent restriction in rider's zone |
| Payout rate | ₹80/hr × 1.25 multiplier (capped at 8 hours per event) |
| Anti-fraud | Government order reference ID required in alert payload |

### Trigger Interaction Rules

- Multiple triggers can fire simultaneously — payouts stack
- Total weekly payout capped at declared daily earnings × 7 (prevents over-insurance)
- 2-hour deduplication window — same trigger type cannot re-fire in same zone within 2 hours
- All triggers are zone-specific (500m radius) — never city-wide

---

## 8. AI/ML Integration

> Both ML models are trained, deployed, and live inside the Docker stack.
> The Flask microservice runs at `http://ml-service:5001` and is consumed
> directly by the Node.js backend. This is not a planned feature — it is
> working code in the repository.

---

### Module 1 — Zone Risk Scoring Model (`/score-zone`)

**Purpose:** Assign each 500m dark store zone a weekly risk multiplier (0.80–1.40) that feeds directly into the premium calculation engine.

**Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Regressor (scikit-learn GBR)
- `max_depth = 3` (shallow trees for regulatory auditability)
- Trained on 365 days of Open-Meteo historical weather data
- 260 weekly training vectors across all 5 Bengaluru zones

**Training features:**

| Feature | Importance |
|---|---|
| Rain days this week | 66.7% |
| Total rainfall mm this week | 21.3% |
| Rain intensity per event | 9.6% |
| AQI exceedance days (last 30 days) | ~1.5% |
| Waterlogging risk score (zone-fixed) | ~0.9% |

**Top 3 features explain 97.6% of variance** — a regulator can understand exactly why Zone A costs more than Zone B.

**Validated performance:**
```
Cross-validation MAE: 0.0082
Actuarial threshold:  0.05
Result: well within acceptable bounds for premium pricing
```

**Live risk scores (verified against real weather data):**
```
Koramangala:  1.37  (high — frequent rain, BBMP flood zone, low-lying terrain)
Indiranagar:  1.12  (medium)
HSR Layout:   1.18  (medium-high)
Whitefield:   1.04  (low-medium — less urban flooding)
JP Nagar:     0.92  (low)
```

**Why GBR over deep learning:** Shallow trees produce auditable feature importances that satisfy IRDAI regulatory requirements. Deep learning cannot provide this transparency. This is an intentional actuarial architecture decision, not a capability limitation.

**Retraining schedule:** Every Sunday night before the new policy week via automated cron job.

---

### Module 2 — Fraud Anomaly Detector (`/fraud-check`)

**Purpose:** Detect outlier rider behaviour patterns that rule-based checks may miss, contributing 40% of the final fraud score.

**Algorithm:** Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)

**Why Isolation Forest, not supervised classification:** No labelled fraud dataset exists for a brand-new insurance product. Isolation Forest is the industry-standard approach for new parametric products — it learns what "normal" looks like and flags deviations without needing pre-labelled fraud cases.

**Training data:** 1,050 synthetic rider profiles (850 legitimate, 200 fraudulent)

**10 behavioural training features:**
- Claim rate per week
- Zone consistency score (how often rider stays in declared zone)
- Policy age in days at first claim
- Night claim ratio (claims outside working hours)
- Delivery activity score before trigger
- Earnings declared vs GPS movement consistency
- Claim frequency in last 30 days
- Dispatch volume during claimed events
- Policy purchase timing relative to weather forecasts
- Zone-switching frequency

**Four fraud archetypes modelled:**
```
1. Claim farmer:       High claim rate, low delivery activity
2. Earnings inflator:  Declared earnings vs actual GPS patterns mismatched
3. Zone jumper:        Claims in zones where rider has no delivery history
4. Zero-activity:      No deliveries recorded but claims disruption
```

**Validated performance:**
```
F1 Score:     0.877
Precision:    0.994  (virtually zero false positives on legitimate riders)
Score gap:    0.52   (legitimate avg 0.16 vs fraudulent avg 0.68 — clean separation)
```

**Score bands:**

| Band | Score Range | Action |
|---|---|---|
| CLEAN | 0.0 – 0.30 | Auto-approve — payout in under 60 seconds |
| SUSPICIOUS | 0.30 – 0.60 | Likely rule-flagged too — insurer review queue |
| ANOMALOUS | 0.60 – 1.0 | Auto-flag or reject |

**Score combination:**
```
final_score = (rule_score × 0.60) + (ml_score × 0.40)

< 0.30    → AUTO APPROVED  → payout in under 60 seconds
0.30–0.80 → FLAGGED        → insurer review queue
>= 0.80   → AUTO REJECTED
```

**Graceful degradation:** If the ML service is unreachable, `callMlFraudCheck()` catches the error and returns `0.0`. No payout is ever blocked due to ML unavailability — the system degrades to pure rule-based scoring, logged via Winston.

---

### Module 3 — Explainable Premium Card

The premium engine exposes a structured explainer object to the frontend showing each factor's rupee contribution. The zone multiplier shown to Ravi is the live GBR model output — not a static lookup table. This satisfies IRDAI InsurTech transparency requirements and is one of ZapShield's core differentiators.

---

## 9. Fraud Detection Architecture

ZapShield's core anti-fraud innovation is **dark store dispatch log cross-referencing** — a mechanism architecturally impossible for food delivery insurance platforms to replicate.

### The Primary Anti-Fraud Signal

```
Dispatch volume during trigger < 40% of same-hour baseline
  -> Store was mostly shut -> disruption was real -> PAYOUT APPROVED

Dispatch volume during trigger >= 40% of same-hour baseline
  -> Store was operational -> income loss unlikely -> CLAIM FLAGGED
```

A rider cannot manufacture a rain event. But even with real rain, if the dark store dispatched 80% of normal orders, that zone was not disrupted. This is objective third-party data that no rider can manipulate.

### Full Fraud Signal Stack

| Signal | Detection Method | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Fake disruption | Open-Meteo actual data (not forecast) verified | Auto-reject if unconfirmed |
| GPS spoofing | Distance from declared zone centroid at trigger time | Flag if >500m |
| Store was open | Dispatch volume >40% during trigger window | Flag |
| No work that day | Zero deliveries before trigger fired | Flag |
| Day-one abuse | Policy <24hrs old at trigger time | Flag |
| Claim farming | ≥3 claims in 7 days | Flag and review |
| Duplicate trigger | Same zone and type within 2-hour window | Block (dedup) |
| ML outlier | Isolation Forest anomaly score | Weighted into final score |

### Insurer Fraud Dashboard

Real-time fraud queue with fraud score, flag reason codes, and one-click approve/reject. Weekly fraud rate analytics by zone and trigger type. Full audit trail: every claim stores the complete raw API response that triggered the event.

---

## 10. Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

> **Threat brief:** A coordinated syndicate of 500 delivery workers organised
> via Telegram is GPS-spoofing their location into red-alert weather zones,
> triggering mass false parametric payouts and draining insurer liquidity.
> Simple GPS distance checks are obsolete.

---

### 7 Attack Vectors, 7 Distinct Defences

Before designing defences, we map every possible attack. A Guidewire underwriter does not design a policy without first enumerating every way it can be abused.

---

#### Attack Vector 1 — Basic GPS Spoof

**The attack:** Rider stays home, uses GPS spoofing app, sets fake coordinates inside the weather zone.

**Detection:** Real GPS in urban Bengaluru has 15–40m of natural drift from multipath interference. A spoofing app emits a synthetically perfect coordinate — variance near zero.

```
GPS jitter variance < 3m over 5 minutes → FLAG: gps_too_clean (+0.30)
```

---

#### Attack Vector 2 — Timed Real-Event Spoof (PRIMARY THREAT)

**The attack — the loophole our basic system does NOT stop alone:**

Syndicate monitors forecasts. Members buy policies 2–3 days before a genuine rain event (passing policy age check). On rain day, dispatch drops naturally because rain is real (passing dispatch check). Members stay home and spoof GPS.

**This simultaneously defeats:**
- Dispatch log check (store IS disrupted — rain is real)
- Policy age check (policies are 2–3 days old)
- Claim frequency check (first claim, clean history)

**What the syndicate still cannot fake during a real event:**
```
1. GPS trajectory: no delivery loops in zone for last 60 minutes
2. Cell tower: device physically at home, not in zone
3. GPS jitter: coordinate too static despite real rain turbulence
4. Population: 500 simultaneous first-time claims — statistically impossible
5. Device history: PWA shows zero zone presence before spoof activated

Combined response:
  gps_trajectory_impossible:  +0.45
  cell_tower_mismatch:         +0.50
  gps_jitter_too_clean:        +0.30
  claim_velocity_ring:         ZONE LOCKDOWN (overrides all individual scores)
```

The population pattern — hundreds of riders with zero zone delivery history, perfect GPS, and home-area cell towers all claiming in the same 10-minute window — is the unmistakable syndicate fingerprint.

---

#### Attack Vector 3 — Insider Dark Store Collusion

**The attack:** A syndicate member bribes a dark store employee to suppress dispatch volume on a clear day — making ZapShield see "disruption confirmed" when no weather event exists.

**Defence:** Our trigger requires dispatch drop AND confirmed Open-Meteo weather data simultaneously. Neither source can fire a trigger alone.

```
Rule: Trigger fires ONLY when:
  Open-Meteo confirms threshold breach (rain/heat/AQI)
  AND dispatch volume < 40% of baseline

Insider can suppress dispatch but CANNOT fake Open-Meteo satellite data.

Dispatch drop > 60% with NO weather event detected:
  → FLAG: unexplained_dispatch_suppression
  → Trigger does NOT fire
  → Insurer alerted for investigation
```

---

#### Attack Vector 4 — Claim Farming via Policy Cycling

**The attack:** A legitimate rider recruits 20 friends to buy policies in the same zone before monsoon, splits payouts, cancels after season.

**Defence:**
```
Zone saturation monitor:
  New policies in zone this week > 3× rolling 8-week average
  → FLAG: zone_policy_surge
  → New policies held for 48-hour verification
  → Rider must have prior delivery history in zone before policy activates

A recruited friend who has never worked in Koramangala
cannot buy a Koramangala policy and immediately claim.
```

---

#### Attack Vector 5 — Account Takeover / SIM Swap

**The attack:** Syndicate phishes legitimate rider accounts or executes SIM swaps to use established tenure discounts and clean fraud histories.

**Defence:** Account takeover leaves behavioural fingerprints.
```
Anomaly flags:
  New device fingerprint after 30+ days of same device
  Login from new geographic region
  Claim within 24 hours of device or location change
  → Immediate account hold + OTP re-verification
  → 24-hour cooling period before any claim from account with device change
```

---

#### Attack Vector 6 — Trigger Engine Timing Attack

**The attack:** Syndicate monitors our 15-minute polling cycle, spoofs GPS at T+1 minute after a cycle fires, removes spoof before the next cycle.

**Defence:** GPS history is stored continuously by the PWA every 3 minutes while active.

```
GPS history window: 90 minutes before trigger time
  "Where are you now" AND "where have you been"

Spoof activated at T+1: GPS history from T-90 to T shows home coordinates.
A genuine Ravi has been in his zone for hours.
A timed spoofer has been in the zone for 1 minute.

→ FLAG: no_zone_presence_history (+0.40)
```

---

#### Attack Vector 7 — AI Model Poisoning (Long-Game Attack)

**The attack:** Over months, sophisticated syndicate members behave legitimately — building clean fraud histories, establishing genuine zone activity. Then in peak monsoon they activate simultaneously.

**This is the most sophisticated attack. It cannot be defeated at the individual level — only at the population level.**

```
Temporal cohort analysis (quarterly):
  Riders who joined in same 2-week window
  AND work in same zone
  AND have never claimed before
  AND all claim for the first time in same week

A cohort of 50 riders with identical clean histories who all claim
simultaneously for the first time is statistically impossible without
coordination.

FLAG: coordinated_first_claim_cohort → insurer review

Zone loss ratio > 200% of 8-week rolling average:
  → Automatic zone audit
  → All claims from that week reviewed
  → Trigger engine sensitivity increased for 30 days
```

---

### Anti-Spoofing Signal Stack (Complete)

| Signal | Catches Attack | Spoofable? | Fraud Score Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark store dispatch volume | 1, 2 | Only with insider collusion | +0.35 |
| Open-Meteo cross-validation | 3 (insider) | No — satellite data | Gate |
| GPS jitter variance | 1, 2, 6 | No — physics | +0.30 |
| GPS trajectory (90-min history) | 2, 6 | No — time window too long | +0.45 |
| Cell tower vs GPS cross-check | 1, 2 | No — physical proximity | +0.50 |
| No zone presence history | 6 | No — continuous log | +0.40 |
| Delivery history in zone | 4 | No — third-party logs | +0.25 |
| Device fingerprint change | 5 | No — hardware ID | +0.35 |
| Claim velocity ring detection | 2, 4, 7 | No — aggregate signal | Zone Lock |
| Policy age cohort cluster | 2, 4, 7 | No — DB aggregate | Zone Lock |
| Zone policy surge | 4 | No — DB aggregate | Zone Lock |
| Zone loss ratio spike | 7 | No — actuarial aggregate | Audit |
| Temporal first-claim cohort | 7 | No — population pattern | Review |
| Unexplained dispatch suppression | 3 | No — cross-signal gate | Block |

**The architecture is layered by design.** No single signal is the defence. Each catches a different attack vector. To defeat ZapShield, a syndicate must simultaneously fake: satellite weather data, GPS physics, 90 minutes of location history, cell tower placement, population-level claim timing, and a third-party dark store operational feed. This is not practically achievable.

---

### UX Balance — Protecting Honest Riders From False Positives

**The core tension:** Bad weather degrades exactly the signals we use to verify bad weather. A genuine Ravi sheltering under a tin roof during a Bengaluru downpour has degraded GPS, weak cell signal, and erratic location data.

**Our governing principle:** Distinguish "cannot verify" from "evidence of fraud." These are not the same situation and must never receive the same response.

#### Tier 1 — Auto-Approved (fraud_score < 0.30)
All signals clean. Payout in under 60 seconds. Zero rider friction.

#### Tier 2 — Soft Hold, Auto-Recheck (fraud_score 0.30–0.55)
```
Condition:
  fraud_score 0.30–0.55
  AND Open-Meteo confirms real event
  AND dark store dispatch confirms disruption

Action:
  Hold payout for 30 minutes maximum — NOT permanently
  Auto-recheck when network signal recovers
  If recheck passes → pay with zero rider action required
  Rider message: "Payment processing — confirming zone conditions.
                  Usually completes in 30 min."

Why 30 minutes: aligned with typical Bengaluru rain burst duration.
```

#### Tier 3 — Assisted Review (fraud_score 0.55–0.80)
```
Route to insurer fraud queue
Rider notified within 2 hours — plain-language reason code, no jargon
One-tap self-attestation — no uploads, no phone calls
4-hour maximum resolution SLA
If attestation + recheck passes → approve with 10% top-up (see below)
```

#### Tier 4 — Blocked (fraud_score > 0.80 OR ring detection)
```
Individual: payout blocked, 7-day formal appeal process

Ring detection: ALL syndicate claims held
  Legitimate riders confirmed by cell tower to be physically in zone
  are AUTOMATICALLY separated from ring batch and processed Tier 1/2
  They are NEVER penalised for being in the same zone as a syndicate.
```

#### The Honest Rider Guarantee (Actuarial Decision, Not UX Gesture)

Any claim held more than 2 hours and subsequently approved:
```
Approved payout = calculated_payout × 1.10
```

A claim that survives full adversarial review carries near-zero residual fraud risk. The 10% top-up costs less than the customer acquisition cost of replacing a verified honest rider who abandons the platform after a false flag. It also incentivises genuine riders to complete attestation — protecting loss ratios by retaining verified clean riders in the premium pool.

## 11. Market Crash Response — Stress-Tested Viability

> **Scenario:** Q-commerce funding dries up. Zepto and Blinkit cut rider
> payouts by 30%. Platform order volumes drop 40%. ZapShield's insured
> population loses income. Does ZapShield survive?

This is not a hypothetical. The Indian startup funding environment is cyclical, and Q-commerce has burned through significant venture capital. ZapShield must be viable under stress, not just in the base case.

---

### Stress Scenario Modelling

| Variable | Base Case | Market Crash |
|---|---|---|
| Active rider pool | 10,000 | 6,500 (35% churn) |
| Average weekly premium | ₹59 | ₹44 (tier-downgrade effect) |
| Weekly gross premium | ₹5,90,000 | ₹2,86,000 |
| Trigger frequency | Normal | +40% (riders work worse conditions) |
| Loss ratio | 65% | 85% (financial stress → moral hazard rises) |

**Crash scenario unit economics:**
```
Weekly gross premium pool:           ₹2,86,000
Expected claims (85% loss ratio):   ₹2,43,100
Payment processing (2%):             ₹5,720
ML infrastructure + ops:             ₹20,000
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Net weekly margin (crash):           ₹17,180
```

ZapShield remains technically solvent in the crash scenario — margin compressed but not negative.

---

### Why ZapShield is Structurally Crash-Resilient

**1. The product is counter-cyclical.**

In a market downturn, Q-commerce platforms cut costs — which often means riders work in worse conditions (heat, rain, peak hours) to maintain volumes. More triggers = more perceived value = higher retention during financial stress. A market crash is simultaneously ZapShield's hardest financial test and its strongest marketing moment.

**2. Weekly pricing is an actuarial circuit breaker.**

If claims spike to a 90% loss ratio, ZapShield can increase zone risk multipliers the following Sunday. Monthly or annual products cannot do this. Weekly renewal is not just a user acquisition feature — it is our primary loss ratio control mechanism.

**3. The distribution model caps exposure.**

ZapShield is an InsurTech distribution platform, not the risk-bearing entity. Underlying risk is underwritten by a licensed Indian non-life insurer (ACKO, Go Digit, or Bajaj Allianz). A claims spike above the target loss ratio is the underwriter's capital problem. ZapShield's distribution fee (15–20% of premium) is earned regardless of claims.

**4. Fraud detection adapts automatically under stress.**

Financial stress increases moral hazard. Our Isolation Forest model is retrained weekly — as fraudulent claim patterns emerge during a crash, they enter the training corpus within 7 days. The system adapts to the threat environment it is actually operating in.

**5. Reinsurance tranche structure (Phase 3 target).**

The parametric trigger architecture maps cleanly to cat bond and parametric reinsurance structures. A zone that hits 3 rain-burst triggers in one week can be bounded by a reinsurance layer activating at the third trigger — limiting the insurer's tail exposure in a monsoon catastrophe. This makes the product financeable even in stressed capital markets.

---

### What ZapShield Does NOT Do in a Crash

- We do not cancel policies mid-week. Coverage contractually runs to the end of the 7-day period.
- We do not reduce payouts unilaterally. The parametric formula is fixed at policy purchase time.
- We do not exclude claims arising from platform-driven income loss (dark store closures, algorithm changes) — those are Trigger 4/5 events, already priced.

These guarantees matter specifically for Ravi. He doesn't have a lawyer to read the fine print. The product must be unconditionally trustworthy at the moment he most needs it.

### Database Schema (8 Tables)

```sql
zones            -- 500m dark store zones, current_risk_multiplier
riders           -- mobile, partner_id, aadhaar_last4, zone_id, kyc_verified
otps             -- bcrypt hashed OTPs with expiry (never plaintext)
policies         -- tier, base_premium, zone_risk_multiplier, season_factor,
                 -- tenure_discount, final_weekly_premium, coverage_start/end
trigger_events   -- trigger_type, actual_value, dispatch_volume_pct,
                 -- api_source, raw_api_response (full audit trail in JSONB)
claims           -- AUTO-CREATED ONLY. No submitted_by field exists.
                 -- fraud_score, fraud_flags (JSONB), approved_payout,
                 -- razorpay_payout_id, status
admin_users      -- insurer dashboard users with role-based access
zone_risk_history -- weekly ML model outputs per zone (actuarial record)
```

**Design note for judges:** The `claims` table has no `submitted_by` column. It cannot be created via any rider-facing endpoint. This architectural constraint enforces the parametric-only coverage rule at the database level, not just in application code.

### End-to-End Flow

```

  |
  v
Dedup check: no open rain_burst trigger in last 2 hours?
  | YES -> proceed
  v

## 16. Coverage Compliance

ZapShield strictly adheres to all Guidewire DEVTrails 2026 constraints. These are **enforced at the code level**, not just in documentation.

| Constraint | ZapShield Implementation |
|---|---|
| Income loss only | All payouts = hourly_rate × trigger_multiplier × duration_hours. No vehicle repair, medical, or accident field exists anywhere in DB schema or codebase. |
| Weekly pricing only | Policy duration is exactly 7 days, hardcoded via `POLICY_DURATION_DAYS` constant. No daily/monthly/annual option exists in any endpoint or UI. |
| Parametric auto-trigger only | The `claims` table has no rider-facing POST endpoint. Claims are INSERT-ed exclusively by the trigger engine. The `claims` table has no `submitted_by` column — it does not exist by design. |
| No health/life/accident | Explicitly excluded from all DB schema, API responses, and UI. |

---

## 17. Business Viability

### Market Size

- ~5 million active Q-commerce riders in India (2025 estimate)
- Target addressable market (smartphone-native, UPI-active): 1.5 million riders
- At ₹49/week average premium and 5% penetration: ₹1.84 Crore/week gross premium

### Unit Economics at 10,000 Riders

```
Weekly gross premium pool:        ₹5,90,000
Expected claims (65% loss ratio): ₹3,83,500
Payment processing fees (2%):      ₹11,800
ML infrastructure + ops:           ₹30,000
──────────────────────────────────────────
Net weekly margin:                 ₹1,64,700   (~₹85 lakhs/year)
```

### Business Model

ZapShield is an InsurTech distribution platform, not a risk-bearing entity. Underlying risk is underwritten by a licensed Indian non-life insurer (target partners: ACKO, Go Digit, Bajaj Allianz). ZapShield earns a 15–20% distribution fee on premium collected.

### Regulatory Pathway

- Parametric insurance recognised under IRDAI Sandbox Framework (2019)
- Gig worker income protection covered by IRDAI 2022 microinsurance guidelines
- Weekly premium structure compliant with IRDAI flexible premium payment rules
- Excluding health/life/accident eliminates the IRDAI Category I licence requirement
